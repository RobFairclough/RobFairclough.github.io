This is my web portfolio, written in HTML, CSS and JS. It was built using Bootstrap 4.0 for responsive formatting and uses JQuery to aid in the smooth scrolling links.
The projects linked are also hosted on Github Pages and the JavaScript algorithms are stored on my GitHub. 

For any questions, comments or criticisms feel free to contact me via GitHub or e-mail at Rob.A.Fairclough@gmail.com
